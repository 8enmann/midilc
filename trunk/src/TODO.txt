Things to add/fix:

- Implement full equality testing (as in LRM 5.4.3)
- Implement set_instrument using strings
- Change PPQ to 4 from 16
- Write full sample programs/songs
- Improve break/continue mechanism?
- Fix filename bug in testall.sh (very low priority)

Add things as soon as you think of them
